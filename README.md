# SIEMs-I-II

Unit 18 Homework

In this unit focued on one of the most popular types of software that security professionals use to monitor their environments: SIEM, which stands for "security information and event management." While there are many different SIEM vendors in today's marketplace, we will be primarily focusing on one vendor: Splunk. This week we will learn about Splunk's core functionalities, and next week we will preview Splunk's SIEM product, Splunk Enterprise Security.

This first of two units dedicated to SIEM will include the following:

•	Day 1 I covered why and how businesses monitor their environment, how they use alerts to detect security events, and what makes SIEM such a powerful product for managing the many challenges of security monitoring.

•	Day 2 I introduce a big data analyzation tool called Splunk. I learned how to use Splunk's Search and Reporting application to create basic and complex Splunk searches.

•	Day 3 I built on the concepts covered on Day 2, exploring Splunk's reporting and alerting capabilities. I also learned the importance of "good" alerts and how to build them.


The Scenario for this assignment was as follows:

You have just been hired as an SOC Analyst by Vandalay Industries, an importing and exporting company.

•	Vandalay Industries uses Splunk for their security monitoring and have been experiencing a variety of security issues against their online systems over the past few months.

•	You are tasked with developing searches, custom reports and alerts to monitor Vandalay's security environment in order to protect them from future attacks.



UNit 19 Homework

In the second of the SIEM units, I continued learning about the many features and functions Splunk provides to security professionals.

The week will include:

•	On Day 1, I built on the topics covered in the previous unit, creating visualizations and dashboards to better understand an organization's security posture.

•	On Day 2, I explored Splunk's SIEM product, Enterprise Security, and how cyber professionals use this product to protect their organization. 

o	I was also introduced the various certifications that Splunk offers, and career paths that use the skills learned in these two units. I also started a Splunk certification: Splunk Fundamentals 1.

•	Day 3 will be a mini-project covering many recent topics. This fun and challenging project will simulate using Splunk to design an SOC to protect your organization against attacks.


The Scenario for this assignment was as follows:

In the previous class,  you set up your SOC and monitored attacks from JobeCorp. Now, you will need to design mitigation strategies to protect VSI from future attacks.

You are tasked with using your findings from the Master of SOC activity to answer questions about mitigation strategies.
